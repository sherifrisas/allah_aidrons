Sensors (Camera, Lidar, IMU, GPS)
Perception (Object Detection, SLAM)
Decision Making (Path Planning, Obstacle Avoidance)
Control (Flight Controller, Motor Commands)
User Input (Gesture/Voice)
Swarm Communication
2. Recommended Hardware
Onboard Computer: NVIDIA Jetson Nano/Xavier, Raspberry Pi 4, or similar (for AI processing)
Flight Controller: Pixhawk (ArduPilot or PX4)
Sensors: Camera (RGB/Depth), Lidar/Ultrasonic, IMU, GPS, Microphone (for voice)
Wireless Module: WiFi/Telemetry for swarm
3. Software Stack
OS: Ubuntu (for Jetson/RPi)
Middleware: ROS (Robot Operating System) – integrates all modules
AI Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
Drone SDK: MAVSDK, DroneKit, or ROS packages for PX4/ArduPilot
4. Module Breakdown & Integration
a. SLAM (Mapping & Localization)
Use RTAB-Map or ORB-SLAM2 (ROS packages)
Input: Camera/Lidar, IMU, GPS
Output: Real-time map, drone pose
b. Object Detection/Tracking
Use YOLOv5 or TensorFlow Object Detection API
Input: Camera frames
Output: Bounding boxes, object classes, positions
c. Path Planning & Obstacle Avoidance
Use move_base (ROS Navigation Stack) or custom planners
Input: Map (from SLAM), detected obstacles, target position (from object tracking or user input)
Output: Waypoints, velocity commands
d. Gesture/Voice Control
Gesture: Use OpenCV + MediaPipe for hand/pose detection
Voice: Use Vosk or Google Speech-to-Text for voice commands
Input: Camera (for gesture), Microphone (for voice)
Output: High-level commands (e.g., "follow me", "land", "go home")
e. Swarm Intelligence
Use ROS multi-master or MAVLink communication
Share positions, goals, and sensor data between drones
Implement consensus or leader-follower algorithms
5. Integration Example (ROS-based)
Each module runs as a ROS node. Nodes communicate via topics/services:
/camera/image_raw → [Object Detection Node, SLAM Node]
/slam/pose → [Path Planning Node]
/object_tracker/target_pose → [Path Planning Node]
/voice_cmd or /gesture_cmd → [Path Planning Node]
/swarm/peer_states → [Swarm Coordination Node]
/cmd_vel → [Flight Controller Node]

7. Development Steps
Set up ROS and required packages on your onboard computer.
Test each module independently (e.g., run SLAM, then object detection, then path planning).
Integrate modules via ROS topics/services.
Test in simulation (Gazebo, AirSim) before real flights.
Deploy to real drone and tune parameters.
For swarm: Set up communication between drones (WiFi mesh, ROS multi-master, or MAVLink).

10. Final Advice
Start simple: Get each module working alone before integrating.
Use simulation: Test in Gazebo or AirSim to avoid crashes.
Leverage ROS: It’s designed for exactly this kind of modular robotics integration.
Document and version control: Use Git and keep notes on your setup.
